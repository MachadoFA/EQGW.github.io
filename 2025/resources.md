# Workshop Resources #


## For workshop participants ##

* [Slack Page](https://eqgw2025mlbs.slack.com)
Slack is a free messaging platform we will use in the course to communicate with
one another. It is a great way to quickly coordinate, ask questions, and share 
materials. The Slack page will continue after the course. Note that we are using
the free version, so messages disappear after 3 months. Please download any 
materials or information that you want to preserve. 

* [Website](https://eqgw.github.io)
The primary way of navigating course materials, including presentation slides and
lab exercise data and code will be through the schedule on the website. 

* [How to get ready for the workshop!](/2025/howtogetready.html)
  * [Reading list](/2025/readinglist.html)
  * [Read about Steve Arnold's book, "Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics", and see animations of figures](https://phenotypicevolution.com/)
  * [Joe's Theoretical Population Genetics Book](https://felsenst.github.io/pgbook/pgbook.pdf)
  
* [Github page for Course Materials](https://github.com/eqgw/eqgw.github.io)
The entire website and materials will be posted here on github. 

* [Installing and using R & Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
R is a free statistical computing program that will be used throughout the course. 
Rstudio Dekstop is an integrated development environment for R that has features
that will be useful. If you are new to R, we recommend its use in the course. 
Instructions for the installation of R and Rstudio can be found at at the Rstudio 
[site](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Please install before June 9th.  Even if you already use R you might 
want to install the most up-to-date version so that new package installations are 
easier.

* Installing and using git
This is optional, but if you want to be able to interact with the github repository
and easily download course materials all at once, we recommend you use git.
